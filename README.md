# kickstats-website
Kickstats was a project I worked on in college to explore data from the Kickstarter crowd funding platform, with the
goal of determining which properties of a project influence its level of success. The project itself is described in
depth at our website, [https://kickstats.org](https://kickstats.org). This repository contains the source code of the
website, plus source code that we used in the project in the `/public/src` directory.
